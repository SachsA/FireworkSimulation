# OpenGL Firework Simulation

##### Project done in Computer Graphics, at KMU, South Korea

### The Project
##### It's developed in C++ with OpenGL

##### It's a Firework simulation made with C++ language and OpenGL.
##### You can see here: a some spheres lanched from the ground into the air, they are in diferent colors, and they give birth to other spheres which are impacted by some customizable rules impacting their mass, gravity, velocity...
##### The code is pretty well optimized.

### You can change the mass, damping, velocity, acceleration.. of the initial fireworks in the Fire(); function.
### You can add/remove/change the rules impacting in the children in the Fireworks(); constructor.

### Usage
How to use the project ?

Open the solution with visual studio and launch it.

You have to link all the librairies to be able to launch the project.
### See the Tutorial.pptx file at the root of the repository to know how to link everything.
